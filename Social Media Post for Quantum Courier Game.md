# Social Media Post for Quantum Courier Game

## LinkedIn Post

ðŸŽ® **Just built my first game with Amazon Q CLI and it's out of this world! #AmazonQCLI #GameDev**

Excited to share "Quantum Courier: A Space-Time Delivery Adventure" - a puzzle game I created using Amazon Q CLI as part of the AWS Build Games Challenge!

In this game, you play as a delivery specialist who can manipulate quantum states and time flow to complete package deliveries across challenging environments. The mechanics include:

âœ… Quantum state shifting to pass through certain barriers
âœ… Time dilation controls to speed up or slow down movement
âœ… Energy management for your special abilities
âœ… Multiple delivery puzzles with increasing complexity

What amazed me was how Amazon Q CLI helped streamline the development process. From generating the core game logic to implementing the physics for quantum state tracking, it was like having an AI pair programmer right in my terminal!

The most challenging part was implementing the causality engine that prevents time paradoxes, but with a few well-crafted prompts, Amazon Q CLI suggested an elegant solution using state management patterns I hadn't considered.

If you're curious about AI-assisted game development or want to try the challenge yourself, check out the AWS community page. The challenge runs until June 20th, 2025!

ðŸŽ® Just built "Quantum Courier" - a space-time puzzle game with #AmazonQCLI!

Toggle quantum states, manipulate time, and deliver packages across mind-bending levels.

Amazon Q CLI made coding the physics and state management so much easier!

ðŸš€ **From idea to playable game in one weekend!**

Meet "Quantum Courier" - my entry for the AWS Build Games Challenge using Amazon Q CLI! This puzzle-adventure lets you manipulate quantum states and time flow to complete deliveries across space stations.

Amazon Q CLI was like having an AI co-developer, helping me implement complex mechanics with simple prompts. The quantum physics simulation that would have taken days was coded in hours!

Swipe to see gameplay of the quantum state shifting and time dilation effects in action!
